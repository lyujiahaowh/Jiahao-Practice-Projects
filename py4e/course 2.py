# Variables - A variable is a nemed place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable "name"
# Programmers choose names for variables that are meaningful to the program
# You can change the content of a variable at any time
# Python variable name rules - 1. must start with a letter or underscore 2. must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores 3. case sensitive

# Sentences - A sentence in a program is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute
# Sentences have structure and syntax
# A sentence in Python is composed of expressions and statements
# Sentences must end with a new line character
# Sentences or Lines - x = 2 is an assignment statement / x = x + 2 is an assignment/assignment with experssion statement / print(x) is an expression/print statement

# Mnenomics - A memory aid, usually involving a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations, that assists in remembering something. It is only good for humans, not computers.
# Phython does not understand plural nouns, so it is better to use singular nouns for variables
# However , it is helpful to use plural nouns for lists when something has more than one value
# Python does not understand past tense, so it is better to use present tense for variables

# Assignment Statements
# We assign a value to a variable using an assignment statement (=)
# An assignment statement consists of an experession on the right-hand side and a variable to store result
