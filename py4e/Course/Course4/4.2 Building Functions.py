# def function will not run itself automatically

# arugments
# an argument is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function
# we use arguments so we can direct the function to do different kinds of work when we call it at different times
# we put the arguments in the parentheses after the name of the function

# parameters
# a parameter is a variable which we use int he function definition
# it is a "handle" that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a particular function invocation

# return values
# often a function will take its arguments, do some computation,
# and return a value to be used as the value of the function call in the calling expression
# the return keyword is used for this
