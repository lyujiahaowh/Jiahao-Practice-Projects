# Definite loops are finite. 
# They are going over, say, all the lines in the file or all the items in a list or all the characters in a string or something. 
# And for this, we use the "for" construct. 

# a simple definite loop
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
    print(i)
print('Blastoff!')

# a definite loop with strings
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends :
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print('Done!')

# Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop.
# These iteration variables move through the sequence or set. 

# The iteration variable “iterates” through the sequence (ordered set)
# The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence
# The iteration variable moves through all of the values in the sequence
