# Best Friends: Strings and Lists
# Split breaks a string into parts and produces a list of strings.  
# We think of these as words.  We can access a particular word or loop through all the words.

print(len(stuff))

# When you do not specify a delimiter, multiple spaces are treated like one delimiter
line = 'A lot               of spaces'
etc = line.split()
print(etc)
# You can specify what delimiter character to use in the splitting
line = 'first;second;third'
thing = line.split()

# The Double Split Pattern
# Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one of the pieces of the line and split that piece again
